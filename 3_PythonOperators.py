# Python Operators
"""
Python operators are symbols that are used to perform
operations on values and the variables that hold those values.

# 1 Assignment operator (=)
name = "Anoop"

# 2 Arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /, //(floor div), %(remainder), **(exponentiation))

remainder_ = 8 % 3
print(remainder_)
exp_ = 3**6

# We can use + and * on strings as well
print("Anoop" + " Bose")

print("Anoop "*3)

# Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)

# BOOLEAN OPERATORS (NOT, AND, OR)

# what happens when you type NOT x ?
# what happens when you type x AND y ? (AND needs both values to be true to return true)
# what happens when you type y OR x ? (OR needs only 1 value to be true to return true)
